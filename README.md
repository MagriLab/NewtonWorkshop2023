# NewtonWorkshop2023
Material for Newton Institute Tutorial 2023
by Luca Magri with assistance from PhD students Defne Ozan and Daniel Kelshaw for the codes.

Handouts for feedforward and convolutional neural networks (no physics): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7538419

Day 1: Feedforward neural networks; hard-physics-constrained neural networks for nonlinear waves.

Day 2: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); soft-physics-constrained CNNs for super-resolution of turbulence (Navier-Stokes PDEs)
