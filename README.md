# NewtonWorkshop2023
Material for Newton Institute Tutorial 2023
by Luca Magri with assistance from PhD students Defne Ozan and Daniel Kelshaw for the codes.

## Setting Up:
First create a new virtual environment

```bash
$ python -m venv venv;
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

**Note:** You can equally use `conda`.

Install the requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally create a new ipykernel:

```bash
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=newton_workshop
```


## Information:

Handouts for feedforward and convolutional neural networks (no physics): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7538419

Day 1: Feedforward neural networks; hard-physics-constrained neural networks for nonlinear waves.

Day 2: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); soft-physics-constrained CNNs for super-resolution of turbulence (Navier-Stokes PDEs)
